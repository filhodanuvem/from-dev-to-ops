### How to study

You can use this repository in two different ways; 
* Do every exercise from the scratch following the README files on each chapter folder. As I'm using this repo to add my solutions, create your own to put yours.  
* Another option would be simply reading the problem and looking at the current solution, in case of suggestion please open an issue or send a pull request.
