# 5 - Secrets 

### Problem 

In this chapter you should be able to use a value inside one of your services that is considered a 
sensitive value, a secret. 
Because of that, you cannot simply add the value (for example, a database password) in plain text
in the repository.
You can study about sealedsecret but I recomend the
usage of vault instead.
