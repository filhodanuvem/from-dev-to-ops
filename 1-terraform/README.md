# 1 - Terraform

### Problem 

The idea of this chapter is to get familiar with terraform since you will use it extensively in the coming ones. 

I recommend you the solve the following problem, because there are a lot of networking concepts involved on it and that might be helpful in the next chapter. 

```
Create and deploy a lambda function that is not accessible outside of a private network but which has access to https://checkip.amazonaws.com/. Use terraform to manage the resources. 
```
